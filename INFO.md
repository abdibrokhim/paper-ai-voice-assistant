# Paper AI

Paper AI - the ultimate Open-source AI-powered research companion that streamlines literature reviews, enhances real-time collaboration, and offers a smart voice assistant to revolutionize your research experience.

## Project Description

Paper AI is an innovative web application that transforms academic research by integrating artificial intelligence, collaborative tools, and an AI voice assistant similar to Apple's Siri. Users can upload research papers and interact with them by annotating, highlighting, and adding personal notes. When text is highlighted, the integrated AI—powered by OpenAI's latest o1 language models and the AI/ML API—instantly provides explanations and summaries, enhancing comprehension of complex concepts.

A standout feature is the AI Voice Assistant, powered by ElevenLabs, which allows users to interact with the platform using voice commands. For example, a user can click the assistant button and say, "Hey, any updates from my co-researcher Wei Tang?" This feature streamlines communication and keeps researchers informed in real-time, making the research process more efficient and engaging.

The tool reaches learners—including researchers, students, and academics—by being globally accessible online with multilingual support. It addresses challenges like information overload and time-consuming literature reviews, improving learning outcomes such as increased comprehension and reduced research time. By fostering a shared learning ecosystem, it encourages collaboration across disciplines and geographic boundaries.

Technologically, Paper AI is built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel for optimal performance. It utilizes the open-source Adobe PDF Embed API as the core of the platform, allowing seamless interaction with PDF documents. The AI functionalities are powered by OpenAI's latest o1 language models and the AI/ML API, providing advanced natural language processing capabilities.

The AI Voice Assistant leverages ElevenLabs' technology for realistic and contextually aware speech synthesis across multiple languages. For data storage and synchronization, the platform uses Google's Cloud Services—including Firebase Auth, Firebase Realtime Database, and Storage—ensuring scalability and reliability. User authentication and management are handled by Clerk, offering comprehensive embeddable UIs and APIs for a seamless user experience.

To enhance performance on the client side, Paper AI employs IndexedDB for storing audio results from the AI Voice Assistant, ensuring that user data is not collected and maintaining data security. This allows for high-performance searches and efficient data retrieval without compromising user privacy.
